      <p>A prominent voice in the Bitcoin community has announced that he is abandoning the cryptocurrency that he helped to popularize. Mike Hearn has revealed that deep divisions within the platform's "leadership" and a looming technical apocalypse threatens the system's entire existence. The creator of bitcoinJ has explained his position in a lengthy Medium post, saying that he has sold his coins and is washing his hands of Bitcoin. As far as he is concerned, the "Bitcoin experiment" has "failed."</p>

      <p>There are several reasons behind his departure, but the most notable is that senior figures in the community are ignoring a key flaw in the software. In Hearn's mind, "the block chain [sic] is full," after an upper limit of 1MB per block was imposed on the system to keep traffic flowing smoothly. Unfortunately, this "temporary kludge," which was added years ago, by Satoshi Nakamoto, has not been removed, thanks to resistance from a group of vested interests. Hearn points a finger to a handful of miners who stand to lose substantial amounts of money if the issue was fixed properly.</p>
