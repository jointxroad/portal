# Joint X-Road community focus


![Joint X-Road Community](../images/Joint%20X-Road%20Community.png)

## What is the community about?


X-Road is the underlying technology or architecture for data exchange layer, which is used both in Finland (Palveluväylä) and in Estonia (X-tee). But why build a community around a technical solution of a wider national architecture and why join one?

> **The Joint X-Road community is not about the core technology of data exchange, but rather a collaboration platform for anyone developing services on top of the architecture.**

While X-Road can be seen as enabler of digitalization of services, the community is about learning from others, and sharing the skills and experiences of how to create better services both technically and business-wise. At its best, it can be about reusing solutions other organizations have already created.

## Out with the organization silos, in with reuse opportunities

The 10-year experience from Estonia has proven that when different organizations are solving inter-connectivity issues, they tend to think that their issues are unique and cannot be solved in a standard way. It is true that some of the issues related to digitalization of services may be organizational rather than technical. Nevertheless, there seem to be common patterns across organizations regardless whether we are talking for example about tax authorities or health services. To detect and solve issues, the people working for organizations providing the X-Road support, RIA in Estonia and VRK in Finland, should not be the only parties solving inter-connectivity issues and connections to X-Road. It makes more sense for developers to post their questions to the community, because another organization may already have a solution or have experienced a similar issue.

In order to support the developers, there are two kinds of materials that either already exist or should be created in the long run:
* Training material and pattern descriptions: i.e. reading material that needs to be read, understood and then re-used
* Technical components that can be re-used instantly or modified for use

## Knowledge base and opportunity for discussion


The plan is to develop Joint X-Road portal to become a knowledge base and a solution library, which will contain a webstore-like interface for components. In addition to the portal, the community has its own Slack channel to support discussion between developers. Join the channel from https://joinxroadcommunity.herokuapp.com/

For question-and-answer-type of communication, the current idea is to use Stack Overflow with a X-Road tag. The Joint X-Road community manager Karri Niemelä plans to follow both Slack discussions and questions in Stack Overflow, pick up the most relevant threads and ensure that the discussion is consolidated into technical patterns or training materials.

For a true community to exist, the community members should also have a chance to meet each other in person. A joint event for both Finnish and Estonian community members is currently being planned for spring 2016. More information will follow, when the plans start to materialize.

If you have ideas and opinions on what the community should shape up to be and what kind of events you would like to participate in, share your thoughts in the Joint X-Road Slack channel.
